    - Parallel to one or both the planes
    - Contained by one or both the planes
    - Perpendicular to plane
    - Inclined to one plane and parallel to other
    - Inclined to both the planes
    - Contained by a plane perpendicular to both the planes
  - True length of a line and its inclinations with the reference plane
  - Trances of line
  - **Types of planes:**
    - Perpendicular planes
